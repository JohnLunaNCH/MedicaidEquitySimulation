<div style="font-size: 0.75em; font-weight: light;">As requested by the Ohio Department of Medicaid, the following statement outlines an Ohio law made effective on September 30, 2021: “A medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer has the freedom to decline to perform, participate in, or pay for any health care service which violates the practitioner’s, institution’s, or payer’s conscience as informed by the moral, ethical, or religious beliefs or principles held by the practitioner, institution, or payer.” From https://www.ebglaw.com/insights/ohios-medical-practitioner-conscience-clause-becomes-effective/ "This makes clear that the new law does not permit refusal to provide services based on who is receiving the services (e.g., declining to provide services to specific patient populations but providing those services to other patient populations). Rather, the new law only protects a conscience-based objection to a specific health care service."</div>
