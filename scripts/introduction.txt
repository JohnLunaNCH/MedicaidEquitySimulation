		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		The purpose of this simulation is to advance health equity for low-income patients by increasing healthcare providers’ sensitivity and empathy towards the challenges faced by disadvantaged patient populations. There are two primary objectives for the simulation:
		<ul>
			<li>Through experiencing some of the challenges faced by a low-income single-parent family, the participant can develop awareness of the barriers these patients encounter in obtaining healthcare. </li>
			<li>To train dentists how to recommend HPV vaccine to age-appropriate youth as cancer prevention, in alignment with the American Dental Association policy.</li>
		</ul>
		<div style="padding: 0 0 1em 0;">
			This simulation consists of two sequential modules. In the first module, you will take on the role of Patricia Rogers, a single parent with a 15-year-old daughter Mia and 9-year-old son Dylan. You will need to make daily life choices that impact on the family’s finance, physical health, emotional wellbeing and time/energy level, as reflected by the stats bar on the top right corner.
