<h3>Introduction</h3>
The purpose of this simulation is to advance health equity for low-income patients by increasing healthcare providers’ sensitivity and empathy towards the challenges faced by disadvantaged patient populations. There are two primary objectives for the simulation:
<ul>
<li>Through experiencing some of the challenges faced by a low-income single-parent family, the participant can develop awareness of the barriers these patients encounter in obtaining healthcare. </li>
<li>To train dentists how to recommend HPV vaccine to age-appropriate youth as cancer prevention, in alignment with the American Dental Association policy.</li>
</ul>
This simulation consists of two sequential modules. In the first module, you will take on the role of Patricia Rogers, a single parent with a 15-year-old daughter Mia and 9-year-old son Dylan. You will need to make daily life choices that impact on the family’s finance (use the image for the ‘wallet icon’), physical health (‘tooth icon’), emotional wellbeing (‘heart icon’) and time/energy level (‘battery icon’), as reflected by the stats bar on the top right corner.
